# Git interactive
Git interactive is a very simple shell script that adds interactive capabilities to both those git commands, all that without moving out of your terminal:
- `git checkout`
- `git branch --delete` (*TODO*)

Checkout [git-fuzzy](https://github.com/bigH/git-fuzzy) for a more complete interactive git experience in your terminal.

## Dependencies
The only dependency is [**fzf**](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), which is available on most platforms.
Refer to their GitHub to have installation instructions.

âš  This script will not work if dependencies are missing.
